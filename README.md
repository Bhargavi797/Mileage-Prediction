# Mileage-Prediction


# Mileage Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the mileage of cars using machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed using a dataset sourced from the StatLib library and is implemented in Google Colab.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is taken from the StatLib library. It includes various features of cars that are used to predict their mileage. 

## Project Structure
- `mileage_prediction_analysis.ipynb`: The Google Colab notebook containing the complete analysis and code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).

## Dependencies
The project is implemented in Python and requires the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
